# ESE exercise app

This is just an exercise project

## Compiling and running

To run just invoke `play` in the directory frontend

    cd frontend
    play

The backend is contained as a compiled jar in frontend/lib, so unless youmodified the code there's no need to compile it. To compile it run `mvn clean install`in the backend directory

    cd backend
    mvn clean install
